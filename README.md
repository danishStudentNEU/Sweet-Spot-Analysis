Introduction:
The Sweet Spot Analysis is a technique used to prioritize strategies based on various factors. This project aims to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) application to facilitate users in conducting Sweet Spot Analysis. The application allows users to input strategy names, factor names, and their corresponding values, which are then sorted based on user-defined factors to provide prioritized strategies.
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly GUI application that enables users to:
1.
Input and define multiple strategies.
2.
Input and define multiple factors for each strategy.
3.
Sort and prioritize strategies based on user-defined factors.
